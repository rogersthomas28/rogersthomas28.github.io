            <p>Thinking about what to do next, I'm deciding on a blog to detail the adventures made in our D&D sessions.
              I'll probably keep the blog element, and add a page for lore, geography, NPCs and then a page for each character and their story so far.

        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Recap:</h4>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>The parties second quest sends them to Saffron city, to follow a lead and find a Gem of Arceus that was hinted at by Xander. </p>
          <p>Whilst stopping off at an inn, they bump into Jenny - a paladin working for the Order of the Gavel - who is investigating a series of high profile thefts.
             The thefts in question are hitting the main banks of Saffron and there are no obvious signs of breaking in and out. The gang goes to investigate.</p>
          <p>After questioning the four banks that were hit (as well as the two that weren't), the party go on a wild goose chase before bumping into a Halfling named Gilly in a nearby town.
             Gilly plies them all with drinks and they all have a merry old time (except Benny). During the merriments, Gilly pulls out <em>blue gem</em>, the size and shape of an apple.
             She performs tricks for the players such as stepping through solid objects and teleporting around the room.</p>
          <p>The players realised that this is probably a gem, however <b>their characters fail to connect the dots</b>. In the morning, Gilly has gone.</p>
          <p>So what should the players do? They've been hunting for days and have come up with nothing. With Jenny's help, they decide that a stake out is in order.</p>
          <p>One of the bank is under the protection of a defensive wizard, so they attempt the other one, who is putting all their money into henchmen - including Xander force.
            The plan is to consolidate all the funds into two vaults and hide the team inside. What could go wrong?</p>
          <p>During the night, Gilly appears in the safe and reveals herself as the thief but is reluctant to hand herself in.
             The players instead decide to lie to Jenny about the identity of the thief and tell her that it was a team of ninjas - <em>or some shit like that.</em>
             Jenny belives them and continues her quest to find out.
             She also explains that she was to be sent to investigate some missing kids in a town in Fuchsia after catching this thief.
             Since she can't leave yet, she asks the team to check it out.</p>
          <p>In the final part of this chapter, the team meet up with Gilly who gives them some loot as thanks.
             She then promises not to hit the last bank and instead explains that she's going to try and find her partner Kurzol who was sent as punishment to work in the gold mines.</p>
          <p>The party continues their quest to Fuchsia...</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Quest 1 - Death of Xander Bramble-Bramble</h3>
        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Recap:</h4>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Like most adventures, this one starts at the beginning. In Celadon City with a powerful - albeit eccentric - mage named Xander Bramble-Bramble and his young apprentice, Gambit.</p>
          <p>Xander has spent his life researching the mythical Gems of Arceus, and after being laughed at by the Council of Knowledge, he has decided to find the gems himself.
            He sends Gambit to the local inn to reruit some help, and he hires Mormuk and Benny to help him.
            Dimble also agrees to help in exchange for information surrounding an artifact that was recently stolen from his home town. </p>
          <p>When they return, it is obvious that a fight broke out between Xander and an unknown assassin, and it is revealed that Xander died in the assault.
            After fleecing the joint and picking up Xander's spellbook, a red fruit from a mysterious plant and instructions for Dimble to explore the Pewter Museum of Science (among other things), they head to find the assassin's guild.</p>
          <p>The party soon discovers - after a brief jaunt through the sewers, much to Mormuk's dismay - that the assassin works for the Rumoured Slayers, and is called Armstrong Maelstrom.
            They approach Armstrong who convinces them to kill his rivil and nemesis, Miller Mulchums. A fellow assassin and Dwarf.
            The team decide to find Miller and work together to take out Armstrong and steal his money.</p>
          <p>They find Miller at an inn which is also frequented by a ranger named Thortless.
            During a series of misunderstandings, Thor ends up killing Miller and so the party takes him in until he can repay the debt.</p>
          <p>Once Miller has been killed, the party return to collect their earnings and is double crossed by Armstrong.
            A fight ensues and the party ends up getting split in the dark. Dimble turns into a spider, Gambit attempts arson and Mormuk thinks he is fireproof.
            Despite all this, the party kills Armstrong and continue on their quest to find the Gems of Arceus...</p>
